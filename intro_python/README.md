# Python in astronomy
The 'python' code has become a very popular coding system in astronomy, as well as in many other science cases, because of its simplicity, compact grammar, easily shared library system, as well as online support. The hands-on in this school are made based on `python` libraries. In existing experiments, also other codes such as `c++` are used.

## `python` version
The code is constantly changing, but pay attention to use `python` versions more recent than `python 3.7`. Especially `python 2` versions will likely not work

## How to install `python`
We recommend the installation of `python` through a `conda` environment. To install `conda` please follow https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution. Once installed, please consider working in the `base` environment or creating a specific environment for this school.

## A `python` primer
In order to get practical with `python` we recommend to try the online course 
https://github.com/marcogullieuszik/astromundus2017_python and follow the lectures. For this school you should at least practice until 'Model Fitting'
