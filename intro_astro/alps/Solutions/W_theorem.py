As the sample size approaches infinity, the distribution of the test statistic −2logΛ-2 log(Lambda) asymptotically approaches the chi-squared χ_2\chi^2 distribution under the null hypothesis.
Lambda  denotes the likelihood ratio, and the χ_\chi^2 distribution has degrees of freedom equal to the difference in dimensionality of the full parameter space and the subset of the parameter space associated with null hypothesis. 
This result means that one can compute the likelihood ratio Lambda  for the data and compare −2log(Λ)-2\log(\Lambda) to the χ2\chi ^{2} value corresponding to a desired statistical significance as an approximate statistical test.
