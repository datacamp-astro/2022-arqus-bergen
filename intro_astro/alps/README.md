# Introduction

Axion-like particles (ALPs) are pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons proposed as a viable candidate for the Dark Matter particle.
Propagated through the astronomical environments embedded in the magnetic fields, very-high-energy gamma rays can convert to ALPs, manifesting this effect as modification of the observed target spectral distribution.
In this notebook we will using the data from the Perseus galaxy cluster observed with the MAGIC (Major Atmospheric Gamma-ray Imaging Cherenkov) telescopes.
The dataset includes a strong flare of the Active Galactic Nuclei in the center of the cluster, NGC 1275.
The data will analysed with gammapy, the well known open-source python package for gamma-ray astronomy.
We will go through the reconstruction pipeline, the statistical approach, as well as the procedure of setting the constraints in the ALPs parameter space with the NGC1275 data.
